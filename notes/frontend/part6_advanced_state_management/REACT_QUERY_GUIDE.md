 # React Query Guide

React Query is a library for managing, caching, and synchronizing data in React applications. It's designed to make fetching, caching, and updating data in your React components simple and efficient. Here are the fundamentals and the basic workflow of React Query:

### Fundamentals:

1. **Queries:**
   - A query is a request for data. In React Query, you define queries to fetch data from various sources like APIs.
   - Queries are functions that return a Promise with the data.

2. **Mutations:**
   - Mutations are functions that modify data. They are used for actions like creating, updating, or deleting data.
   - Similar to queries, mutations also return a Promise with the updated data.

3. **Query Keys:**
   - Query keys are unique identifiers for queries or mutations. They help React Query keep track of the data associated with each query.
   - Typically, a query key is an array of strings or values that uniquely identify a specific query or mutation.

4. **React Query Hooks:**
   - React Query provides hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation` to interact with queries and mutations in your components.
   - These hooks automatically manage the lifecycle of queries and mutations, including fetching, caching, and updating.

5. **Query Cache:**
   - React Query uses an internal query cache to store and manage the fetched data. This cache helps to avoid unnecessary network requests and provides a consistent state for your application.

6. **Invalidations and Refetching:**
   - React Query automatically invalidates and refetches data based on various events like focus, blur, and manual triggers.
   - You can also manually trigger refetching when needed.

### Basic Workflow:

1. **Install React Query:**
   - Start by installing React Query in your project using a package manager like npm or yarn:

     ```bash
     npm install react-query
     ```

2. **Configure the QueryClient:**
   - Set up a `QueryClient` at the root level of your application. This is where you configure the cache and other options.

     ```jsx
     import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query';

     const queryClient = new QueryClient();

     function App() {
       return (
         <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
           {/* Your app components */}
         </QueryClientProvider>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **Use Queries and Mutations in Components:**
   - Import and use the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks in your components to fetch and update data.

     ```jsx
     import { useQuery, useMutation } from 'react-query';

     function MyComponent() {
       const { data, isLoading } = useQuery('myQueryKey', fetchDataFunction);

       const mutation = useMutation(updateDataFunction);

       // Render your component based on the data and loading state
     }
     ```

4. **Handle Data and Loading States:**
   - React Query provides a set of states like `data`, `isLoading`, `isError`, etc., to handle different aspects of the query lifecycle.

     ```jsx
     function MyComponent() {
       const { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery('myQueryKey', fetchDataFunction);

       if (isLoading) {
         return <p>Loading...</p>;
       }

       if (isError) {
         return <p>Error loading data</p>;
       }

       // Render your component based on the data
     }
     ```

5. **Optimistic Updates (Optional):**
   - React Query supports optimistic updates, allowing you to update the UI optimistically before the mutation is complete.

     ```jsx
     const mutation = useMutation(
       updateDataFunction,
       {
         onMutate: (newData) => {
           // Update the UI optimistically
         },
         onError: (error, newData, rollback) => {
           // Handle errors and rollback the optimistic update
           rollback();
         },
         onSuccess: (data) => {
           // Update the UI based on the successful mutation
         },
       }
     );
     ```

6. **Refetching and Manual Triggers:**
   - React Query provides options for manual refetching and triggers. You can refetch data based on user interactions or other events.

     ```jsx
     const { data, refetch } = useQuery('myQueryKey', fetchDataFunction);

     // Manually trigger a refetch
     const handleButtonClick = () => {
       refetch();
     };
     ```

This is a basic overview of the fundamentals and workflow of React Query. It's a powerful library that simplifies data management in React applications, especially when dealing with complex data fetching and updating scenarios.
