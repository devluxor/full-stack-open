# Quick Reference Guide for Basic CI/CD Deployment Pipeline

## Example file

From now on, this file will be referred to as `example`:

```yaml
name: Deployment pipeline

# This workflow will be triggerred when:
on:
  # a pushed is made...
  push:
    # to branch `main`
    branches:
      - main
  # and when a pull request is made to...
  pull_request:
    # branch main
    branches: [main]
    # when the pull request is opened or updated
    types: [opened, synchronize]

    steps:
        # the `uses` keyword tells the workflow to run a specificÂ *action*. 
        # An action is a reusable piece of code, like a function. 
        # Actions can be defined in your repository in a separate file 
        # or you can use the ones available in public repositories.

## Explanation of `example`

See the [Official Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions>).

This file defines a workflow. In this case, this is the workflow for basic deployment, which consists of:

- Install dependencies in the GitHub virtual machine that will test the code
- Lint source code
- Perform unit tests
- Build code into working version (minimizing, compiling into deployment code, etc.) for production
- Perform E2E tests
- If tests are successful:
    - Deploy to platform (Heroku in `example`)
    - Send message to a Discord server
    - Bump version and push tag to GitHub
- If tests are NOT successful:
    - Send message to a Discord server

### `name` defines a name for the workflow.


### `on` defines which events will trigger these actions

In this case:

- `push` into `main`: every time a commit is pushed into the `main` branch
- `pull_request` into `main`, with `types` `opened` and `synchronize`: The workflow will run when a pull request into the `main` branch is opened or updated.

There are many more triggers available. For example, we could create a timed trigger that could run certain workflow every Monday.

See <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow>.

### `jobs` defines the separate jobs that the workflow will execute.

In this case:

- `deployment_pipeline` (install dep., lint, tests, build, e2e tests, deploy if successful, message to discord)
- `tag_release` (bump version and push tag)

Each job consists on:

- Settings for the job environment
- Steps

And each step consists on, roughly: a name, settings, options, conditions, commands...
